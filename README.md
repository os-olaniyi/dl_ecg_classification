#### ECG CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING.

> **ABSTRACT**
<em>
This study presents an application of the Residual-Dense Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach for the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using the MIT-BIH ECG Arrhythmia dataset. The dataset comprises of five classes of heartbeats. Initial analysis reveals the uneven distribution of data across classes.  Augmentation techniques, such as resampling, address imbalances in data representation. Three variants of the Residual-Dense block model. Each variant employs different optimization functions, with a focus on achieving accurate classification with minimal computational resources. The number of dense layers is constrained to three to optimize efficiency. Variants using Adam optimizer, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and RMSProp exhibit promising performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 97%, yielding robust performance metrics across all classes. This study underscores the efficacy of the Residual-Dense CNN model with limited dense layers in effectively learning ECG signal features and accurately classifying signals, while minimizing computational overhead.
